# Playalong

Playalong your favourite Youtube backing tracks using your NUX portable amplifier.
By using MIDI over BLE you'll be able to set cues that will change either Presets (defined in the amp 1-7) or engage/disengage effects in the effects block. NO NEED FOR A FOOTSWITCH :)

The MIDI CC commands work with NUX Mighty AIR amplifier. Nux Mighty Lite is slightly differet, support will be added in the future.

The effects that can be used are:

* Touch WAH
* Chorus
* Tremolo
* Phaser
* Steel Singer Drive
* Tube Screamer
* Katana booster
* 3 band EQ
* Fuzz
* Crunch
* Dirt Drive
* Morning
* Distortion
* Compressor

It was tested on Chrome browser which supports BLE connections.
